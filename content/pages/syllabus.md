Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics_](/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016) and [_18.02 Calculus II: Multivariable Calculus_](/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010).

Description
-----------

This course is a broad, theoretical treatment of classical mechanics, useful in its own right for treating complex dynamical problems, but essential to understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics and statistical physics.

Class Objectives
----------------

*   Classical Mechanics Power Tools
    *   How to solve the really hard problems with relative ease through Lagrangian Mechanics

*   Preparation for Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Physics
    *   The theoretical foundation for advanced physics lies in Hamiltonian Mechanics

Course Outline
--------------

| LEC # | TOPICS |
| --- | --- |
| 1–4 | Lagrangian Mechanics |
| 5–6 | Conserved Quantities |
| 7–10 | Orbits and Scattering |
| 11–12 | Oscillations |
| 13–14 | Tricky Potentials |
| 15–19 | Hamiltonian Mechanics 

Assignments
-----------

There are 4 problem sets. Doing them is critical to getting the most of this class. Try them alone, then in a group, then ask an upperclassman, then email the Teaching Assistant.

Project
-------

The project problem should look impossible given only 8.01 Physics I, but will not be so bad by week 2 or 3! Do it alone (without help from the internet) whenever you like. Turn it in with the last problem set or earlier for bonus credit).

Grading
-------

Seventy percent of the class grade is based on the Assignments and 30% on the Project.
